# Mona's Christmas WishList JavaScript project 

This is an exercise for the 2019 GRGCAHBC. 
The goal of this project is to learn how to manipulate the DOM, by creating a christmas wishlist. 

My goal is to create this list, add a christmas tree to, from our christmas tree exercise, and also add audio to this to make it a unique and useable project.
